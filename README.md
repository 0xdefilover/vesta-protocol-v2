Vesta is a decentralized borrowing protocol called collateralized debt protocol(CDP). It allows users to draw interest-free loans by locking up collateral. Loans are paid out in VST, Vesta's USD-pegged stablecoin.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing VST and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.
